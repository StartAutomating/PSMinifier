PSMinifier is a minature minifier for PowerShell.

Minification makes your scripts smaller and much harder to read.  Thus it is helpful when trying to reduce filesize, and not helpful when trying to make readable code.

PSMinifier can minify itself with:
    
~~~
# This returns the minified contents of the definition of Compress-ScriptBlock
Compress-ScriptBlock -ScriptBlock (Get-Command Compress-ScriptBlock).ScriptBlock
~~~

Or more elegantly, with:

~~~
# This returns the minified contents of Compress-ScriptBlock, assigned to a variable ${Compressed-ScriptBlock}
Get-Command Compress-ScriptBlock | Compress-ScriptBlock
~~~


If that isn't compact or opaque enough, you can also -GZip the contents of a ScriptBlock

~~~
Get-Command Compress-ScriptBlock | Compress-ScriptBlock -GZip
~~~

If that isn't minified enough, you can pass both -GZip and -NoBlock to recreate the script block in one long line.
~~~
Get-Command Compress-ScriptBlock | Compress-ScriptBlock -GZip -NoBlock
~~~


Both of the preceeding examples minified a function into an anonymous Script Block.  This can be useful for embedding single commands.
You can also minify a .ps1 file to include directly within a module.
~~~
Get-Command Compress-ScriptBlock | # Get Compress-ScriptBlock
    Foreach-Object {$_.ScriptBlock.File }| # Get the file it is declared in
    Get-Command | # get the command (if you were in the directory, this would be Get-Command .\Compress-ScriptBlock.ps1)
    Compress-ScriptBlock -Anonymous # compress the script, but don't assign it to a variable.
~~~


If you want to GZip a ScriptBlock and declare the functions within it, you have to pass -DotSource:

~~~
Get-Command Compress-ScriptBlock | # Get Compress-ScriptBlock
    Foreach-Object {$_.ScriptBlock.File }| # Get the file it is declared in
    Get-Command | # get the command 
    Compress-ScriptBlock -Anonymous -GZip -DotSource # compress and dot-source the script.
~~~


PSMinifier works by walking the PowerShell Abstract Syntax Tree and recreating a minimal version of your script.  As such, any inline help will be lost.
PSMinifier will not minify strings, as to do so would change functionality.

Importantly, _PSMinifier is not an optimizer_.  It does not change the content of your scripts, attempt to improve their performance, or rename your variables.

If PSMinifier fails to minify your script, please open an issue on GitHub.
